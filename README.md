# FastAI-Examples
Deep learning examples and paper reproduction with Fast AI library.

- Hello_World_with_FastAI.ipynb: A basic classification example with MNIST sample dataset. Use Fast AI only, without any customization.
- Use_Pretrained_Models.ipynb: Use pretrained model provided by `Cadene` or `pytorchcv`.
- Use_Customized_Model.ipynb: train self-defined model.
- Save_Features.ipynb: Extract the activations of a module in the model as the features; Visualize the features after dimension reduction using TSNE.

### ToDo
- When use `SaveModelCallback`, how to prevent the Learner from automatically loading the best model?
